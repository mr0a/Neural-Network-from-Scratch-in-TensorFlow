# Neural-Network-from-Scratch-in-TensorFlow
* Here we will not use high level api like keras
### In this course, we are going to focus on two learning objectives:  

-How to implement a neural network model from scratch using TensorFlow.  
-Solving a multi-class classification problem using the neural network implementation.  

By the end of this course, you will be able to implement a Neural Network model in TensorFlow using its core functionality. You will also implement the gradient descent algorithm with the help of TensorFlow's automatic differentiation. Finally, you will be able to use this implementation to solve a multi-class classification problem.
